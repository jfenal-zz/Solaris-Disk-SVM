Installing Solaris::Disk::SVM
=============================

Solaris::Disk::SVM aims to provide methods to read and
manipulate Solaris Volume Manager (aka Solstice Disk Suite)
objects.

To install the module, simply run the following commands
(where x.xx is the current script version):

    $ tar xvzf Solaris-Disk-SVM-x.xx.tar.gz
    $ cd Solaris-Disk-SVM-x.xx
    $ perl Makefile.PL

and as root:

    # make install

If you are used to the CPAN way of doing things, the procedure is the
same as always:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    # make install

At your option, you may use the Build system which doesn't require the make(1)
utility:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ perl Build
    $ perl Build test
    $ su
    # perl Build install

This module requires two other modules:
Solaris::Disk::Partitions and Solaris::Disk::MountTable.
